# Flashcards
This is a simple flashcard program on the command line, that tests the user by asking them to fill in random blanks in a list of flashcards.

See built-in flashcard lists below.
```sh
# run on star signs (default)
python flashcards.py star

# run on hex digits
python flashcards.py hex
```

## Features
- Case insensitive.
- When you get it wrong, it tells you other flashcards you might have gotten it confused with, sorted by similarity.
